Corporal is a statistical corpus analyser.

Its goal is to be able to give people a jar which they can run over their own code corpuses
and then return you some statistics.  An example code corpus might include all the source
code owned by a company.

At the moment it provides a minimal and simple API and only contains a single query related
to JSR 310 development.
